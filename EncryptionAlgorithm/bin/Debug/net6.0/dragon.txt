Name: Ataziel Juntas

Physical Description: Once colorful blue and orange scales have been bleached by the sun, leaving him pale and mostly colorless. Dark twin horns sweep back from the sides of his face, creating an anchor-like shape.
Equipment: Dull plate armor covered by a tattered full-body cloak, hardly more than burlap. Underneath, he conceals a polearm tail-blade and edged bracers, as well as a simple traveler’s bag at his side filled with basic provisions.
Skillset: Fighting and tracking. Trained military precision.
Goals: Ostensibly to take down the Kingdom out of spite. Perhaps to find a meaning in life. Realistically, to survive long enough to reach the next drinking hole.
Fears: Being shanked in the night or being recognized by the military.
Vice(s): Frequently takes to drink, is often found wallowing in self-pity.
Hometown: Astrayus
Starting Point: Moirek
Bio: Ataziel is an ex-soldier who came to despise the war, his officers, his fellow soldiers, and anything to do with kingdom hierarchy. After a fierce battle with Sect soldiers, only he and one other Kingdom soldier stood. As the other soldier prepared to treat their wounds, Ataziel slit his throat and made a sprint for the hills. Now, he wanders aimlessly, easily passing unnoticed as he travels the Kingdom one bar at a time. He’s convinced the Kingdom is even more evil than the Sect and doesn’t believe in such a thing as the “right side” anymore, or even a “good dragon.” To him, each and every dragon is rotten to the core, whether they show it or not.
